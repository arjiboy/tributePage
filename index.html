				<h3>From Rejections To Becoming a Businesman</h3>
				<p>Coming from humble beginnings, his early life was also marked by failures and rejections. In several of his interviews, Ma repeatedly told the same stories of his experiences before Alibaba and even during its early years, emphasizing that he is not special for him to have achieved his current stature.</p>
				<ul>
	              <li>At a young age, Ma would practice English daily by conversing with tourists. He would give them tours around the city for free to improve his English. He did this for 9 years.</li>
	              <li>In his youth, it took him 4 years to pass the college entrance exams. He graduated in 1988 with a B.A. in English.</li>
	              <li>Ma applied to 30 different jobs and was rejected by all. He even told a story where he and 23 others applied in KFC in his city and he was the only one rejected.</li>
	              <li>In addition, he applied for Harvard 10 times and got rejected.</li>
	            </ul>
	            <p>Full of optimism for the future, Ma didn't let these challenges stop him. In 1994, he was introduced to the internet and saw an opportunity.An opportunity that would later lead to the formation of Alibaba after several attempts to be successful in the tech industry. With no programming knowledge (he "never typed a single line of code"), he led and started Alibaba with a group of 18 friends along with 500,000 yuan.</p>
	            <p>In September 2014, Alibaba became one of the most valuable tech companies in the world after raising $25 billion, the largest initial public offering in US financial history.</p>

				<h3>Inspiring Quotes from the Leader</h3>
				<ul>
	              <li>“If you don’t give up, you still have a chance. Giving up is the greatest failure.”</li>
	              <li>“Opportunity lies in the place where the complaints are.”</li>

	              <li>"If you want to grow, find a good opportunity. Today, if you want to be a great company, think about what social problem you could solve."</li>
	              <li>"In the beginning I just wanted to survive. For the first three years, we made zero revenue. I remember many times when I was trying to pay up, the restaurant owner would say, 'Your bill was paid.' And there would be a note saying, 'Mr. Ma, I'm your customer on the Alibaba platform. I made a lot of money, and I know you don't, so I paid the bill.'"</li>
